## Artificial Intelligence
#### [On Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Intelligence) 
ðŸ“– by [Jeff Hawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins) (2005)

The book explains why previous attempts at understanding intelligence and building intelligent machines have failed. It then introduces and develops the core idea of a proposed theory for how the human neocortex generates intelligent behavior, which the author calls the memory-prediction framework.

## Machine Learning
#### [Learning from Data](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse) 
ðŸ¥‡ ðŸ“º ðŸ“– by [Yaser Abu-Mostafa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaser_Abu-Mostafa) (2012)

An introduction to ML with a strong focus on providing a conceptual and theoretical framework for the subject. It's an excellent complement to other courses which provide practical tools for machine learning but fail to explain in sufficient detail the conceptual underpinnings.

#### [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/)
ðŸ“° by [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.facebook.com/) (2018)

Papers with Code was created with the simple idea of helping the community track newly published machine learning papers with source code and quickly understand the current state of the art. It organizes a lot of the papers published in the field, providing summaries and related resources. Although it's sponsored by Facebook AI Research, it is an open community project.

## Philosophy of Mind
#### [GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach -- an Eternal Golden Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) 
ðŸ¥‡ ðŸ“– by [Douglas Hofstadter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hofstadter) (1979)

The book discusses how systems can acquire meaningful context despite being made of "meaningless" elements. It also discusses self-reference and formal rules, isomorphism, what it means to communicate, how knowledge can be represented and stored, the methods and limitations of symbolic representation, and even the fundamental notion of "meaning" itself.
